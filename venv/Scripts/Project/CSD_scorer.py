# ask for study name
# ask for SP no or identifier
# Ask for animal id -- create animal instance?
# ask for session (t1 or t2)
# space to score
# save t1 and t2 scores as animal property
# if animal already has a nonzero t1 or t2 then overwrite the old value
# calculate sp and save as animal property
# if animal already has a nonzero sp then overwrite the old value

# maybe save phenotype property as well, sp < 100 sus etc

# maybe allow user to upload id-group sheet to log group info property

# allow user to upload existing id-sp1-sp2 etc sheet to get info and add onto that sheet, 
# if chosen SP already exists then ask whether to overwrite or enter another sp name or do nothing and restart
